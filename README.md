# Beeg-Systems

## Project Description

The primary objective of the **Beeg-Systems** application is to improve team collaboration by managing a project with issues, tasks, and columns. This setup provides team members with a clear understanding of task progress and the status of other members' work. The application serves as a simple prototype, encapsulating a few user stories derived from a larger assignment description.

## Project Board

The project board connected to this application consists of four columns:

1. **ToDo**: 
   - This column lists tasks that have not yet been started and are scheduled for future work.
  
2. **In Progress**: 
   - This column tracks tasks that are currently being worked on but are not yet complete.
  
3. **Testing**: 
   - Tasks that are marked as complete but require thorough testing to ensure no bugs are present and that they function as expected are placed in this column.
  
4. **Done**: 
   - This column contains tasks that are fully coded, tested, and confirmed as complete.

Utilizing these columns allows the team to easily track the status and progress of tasks.
