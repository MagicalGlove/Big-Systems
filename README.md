# Big-Systems

## Project description:

The main purpose of this application is to work in a team, using a project with issues, tasks and columns. This will give members a clear understanding of how to track the progress of tasks and other members.
The application itself is a simple prototype, only consisting of a few user stories from a bigger assignment description.

## The project board:

The project connected to this application consists of 4 columns.
ToDo, In progress, Testing and Done.
The "ToDo" column is meant for tasks that still have not started and are to be done in the future.
The "In progress" column is for tasks that are currently being worked on and not yet complete.
The "Testing" column is for tasks that appear to be done, but needs to be tested properly in order to make sure no bugs are hiding and that it works as expected.
The "Done" column is for tasks that are complete, thereby being fully coded and tested.

Through the use of all these columns, it is possible to see exactly how far a task is from being completed
